# EBU-TT-D Subtitling within Dash.js

The ebu-subtitling-dev branch has for purpose to experiment the support for XML based subtitles like EBU-TT-D within Dash.js

The current work focus on an HTML/CSS overlay to replace the native approach. This solution allow dash.js to render the subtitles and its properties the closest of the author intentions. In fact, CSS properties are very close from the ones of EBU-TT-D. It is also quite versatile as it allows us to reproduce properties that are not part of the CSS specification.

The core modifications are to be found in the following Javascript classes:

- TextSourceBuffer: will use for "fragmentedText" files the new features instead of TextTrack and VTTCues.
- TTMLParser: An improved TTMLParser to parse the style and positioning and provide the proper data to the renderer.
- CustomCaptions (new): The renderer. Handle the rendering of the subtitles and control their timings.
- CustomControls (new): To manage the overlay arrangement between the video, the subtitles and the controls.

To test it out:
- Create your EBU-TT-D document
- Package it in an ISOBMFF format as DASH specification is requiring (you can use MP4Box as for an example: gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/2014/08/23/ebu-ttd-support-in-gpac/)
- Produce a manifest (you can also use MP4Box)
- Launch a server at the root of the project where dash.js can do HTTP requests to get the media chunks
- Launch index.html (samples/ebu-subtitling-demo) after replacing the source value by your MPD address

A reference client implementation for the playback of MPEG DASH via JavaScript and compliant browsers. Learn more about DASH IF Reference Client.

If your intent is to use the player code without contributing back to this project, then use the MASTER branch which holds the approved and stable public releases.

If your goal is to improve or extend the code and contribute back to this project, then you should make your changes in, and submit a pull request against, the DEVELOPMENT branch. Read through our wiki section on https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/wiki/How-to-Contribute for a walk-through of the contribution process.

All new work should be in the development branch.  Master is now reserved to tag builds.

## Quick Start

### Reference Player
1. Download 'master' or latest tagged release.
2. Extract dash.js and move the entire folder to localhost (or run any http server instance such as python's SimpleHTTPServer at the root of the dash.js folder).
3. Open samples/dash-if-reference-player/index.html in your MSE capable web browser.

### Install Dependencies
1. [install nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
2. [install grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
    * npm install -g grunt-cli

### Build / Run tests
1. Change directories to the build folder
    * cd build/
2. Install all Node Modules defined in package.json 
    * npm install
3. Run all the GruntFile.js task (Complete Build and Test)
    * grunt
4. You can also target individual tasks:
    * grunt uglify
    * grunt jsdoc
    * grunt jshint

## Getting Started
Create a video element somewhere in your html. For our purposes, make sure to set the controls property to true.
```
<video id="videoPlayer" controls="true"></video>
```
Add dash.all.js to the end of the body.
```
<body>
  ...
  <script src="yourPathToDash/dash.all.js"></script>
</body>
```
Now comes the good stuff. We need to create a dash context. Then from that context we create a media player, initialize it, attach it to our "videoPlayer" and then tell it where to get the video from. We will do this in an anonymous self executing function, that way it will run as soon as the page loads. So, here is how we do it:
``` js
(function(){
    var url = "http://dash.edgesuite.net/dash264/TestCases/1c/qualcomm/2/MultiRate.mpd";
    var context = new Dash.di.DashContext();
    var player = new MediaPlayer(context);
    player.startup();
    player.attachView(document.querySelector("#videoPlayer"));
    player.attachSource(url);
})();
```

When it is all done, it should look similar to this:
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Dash.js Rocks</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <video id="videoPlayer" controls="true"></video>
        </div>
        <script src="yourPathToDash/dash.all.js"></script>
        <script>
            (function(){
                var url = "http://dash.edgesuite.net/akamai/test/caption_test/ElephantsDream/elephants_dream_480p_heaac5_1.mpd";
                var context = new Dash.di.DashContext();
                var player = new MediaPlayer(context);
                player.startup();
                player.attachView(document.querySelector("#videoPlayer"));
                player.attachSource(url);
            })();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```
